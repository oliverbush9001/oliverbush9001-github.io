### Duck Guessing Game V2
This was a HTML, CSS, and JS assignment where the player would be prompted to guess how many rubber ducks where hiding. 
We were challenged to improve the game in some way, and I choose to add an option for the player to choose the maximum and minimum amount of ducks, as well as change the background color to a muted purple. 
Templete for the assignment was provided by Janell Baxter, and help was provided by Ann Marie Evans, my partner.
