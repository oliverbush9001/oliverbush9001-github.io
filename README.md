### Weather Data Visualization
This was a HTML, CSS, and JS assignment where I used Public weather data to display the seven day forcast for Chevy Chase, Maryland. I had attempted to do a larger scale data visulization using the E-Scooter rides in Chicago, but the data set ended up being to large and difficult to use, so I pivited to simplier option. Template for the assignment was provided by Janell Baxter, and help was provided by Ann Marie Evans, my partner.

### Duck Guessing Game V2
This was a HTML, CSS, and JS assignment where the player would be prompted to guess how many rubber ducks where hiding. 
We were challenged to improve the game in some way, and I choose to add an option for the player to choose the maximum and minimum amount of ducks, as well as change the background color to a muted purple. 
Template for the assignment was provided by Janell Baxter, and help was provided by Ann Marie Evans, my partner.
