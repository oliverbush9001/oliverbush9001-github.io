### Composition Creator
This assignment using Processing to randomly generate a background color and place a public domain image of a comet over a city with a random position and random dimensions. I was very happy with this as taking an image from the internet meant my algorithm would function without having to download an image. Below are a couple example images.

### Weather Data Visualization
This was a HTML, CSS, and JS assignment where I used Public weather data to display the seven day forcast for Chevy Chase, Maryland. I had attempted to do a larger scale data visulization using the E-Scooter rides in Chicago, but the data set ended up being to large and difficult to use, so I pivited to simplier option. Template for the assignment was provided by Janell Baxter, and help was provided by Ann Marie Evans, my partner.

### Duck Guessing Game V2
This was a HTML, CSS, and JS assignment where the player would be prompted to guess how many rubber ducks where hiding. 
We were challenged to improve the game in some way, and I choose to add an option for the player to choose the maximum and minimum amount of ducks, as well as change the background color to a muted purple. 
Template for the assignment was provided by Janell Baxter, and help was provided by Ann Marie Evans, my partner.

### Project 3: Interactive Website
This is an HTML, CSS, and JS website aiming to help university and college student who, like myself, struggle a lot with mental health and self worth. It was definitly a challenged to dive so deep into my own personal feelings, but I choose to take a personal lense to better relate to my target audience. The hardest part was getting the formatting of the pages to look how I wanted, and while it's certainly not perfect, I do think it turned out pretty good given my limited experience with CSS and HTML.
